# Recursive Tree N-Gram Method

Download all the 3 python files in the same folder and run "main.py". <br/>
"POS.py" is used for parts-of-speech tagging and weight assignment to each word. <br/>
"Stemmer.py" is used for lemmatization of the words. The corresponding partial score assigned to matching lemmas is given in "main.py". <br/>
Since RTN is a recursion based algorithm it might take some time to finish execution if the given corpus is too long.
